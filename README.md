# Conway-s-Game-of-Life
## How to use
- Clone or download the repository.
- Use 'make' command to create an executable file.
- Use './GameOfLife filename.csv number-of-iterations' to run a simulation from a .csv file over a certain amount of iterations.
## Important notes
- App works with .csv files
- Generated output is saved to consecutive .csv files
- Before running the simulation please make sure the .csv file is free of unnecessary newline symbols (leafpad worked fine for me; check example .csv files when in doubt)
